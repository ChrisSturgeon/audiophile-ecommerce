## Built With

- [NextJS 13](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/)

## Features

- Server Side Rendering of product pages
- Responsive design
- Cart functionality through React Context
- Checkout form validation

## Concepts and Ideas Learnt

I undertook this project to improve my understanding of serving responsive images, and to get to grips with Next's new /app directory.

- I deliberately chose not to use Next's Image component but instead the native HTML picture element instead to increase site performance and tackle art direction issues.

- I learnt how layout, routing, and dynamic paths work using the /app directory.

- I gained an understanding of React's new server components and when it's appropriate/necessary to 'use client'.

## Areas to Improve

With more time I would have liked to have implemented more features and improved others, such as:

- Adding a backend to fetch the product data from instead of pulling it from the provided JSON file.

- Undertaken component and integration testing.
